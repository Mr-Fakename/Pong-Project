# Pong-Project

Trying different approaches to building a Pong game; as a way to learn paradigms and clean code
Went from purely functional programming to OOP


## Getting Started

This program was built using Turtle. Just copy/paste Main.py, nothing complicated there !


## To do

* Separate logic from graphics
* Create better classes
* DRY code
* Experiment with Pygame
